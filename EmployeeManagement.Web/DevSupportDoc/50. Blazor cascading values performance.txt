50. Blazor cascading values performance
	To demonstrate something called active monitoring and Performance accepect of Cascading Value
	lets add another propery counter and its method
	and Counter button, and display the counter value next to the parent component value
	Lets also cascade the Counter value down the component tree.

1) CascadingParent.razor

	@page "/cascadingparentc"

	<button class="btn btn-primary" @onclick="IncrementCounter">
		Increment Counter
	</button>

	<h3 style="@Style">Cascading Parent Componet - @Counter</h3>
	<CascadingValue Value="@Counter" Name = "Counter">
		<CascadingValue Value= "@Style" Name = "ColorStyle">
			<CascadingValue Value = "@BorderType" Name = "BorderStyle">
				<CascadingChild></CascadingChild>
			</CascadingValue>
		</CascadingValue>
	</CascadingValue>


	@code {
		public string Style { get; set; } = "color:red";
		//public int EmployeeAge { get; set; } = 25;
		public string BorderType { get; set; } = "border:1px solid red";
		public int Counter { get; set; } = 0;

		private void IncrementCounter()
		{
			Counter = Counter + 1;
		}

	}
Note : Now, we can access the Counter Value in the Child Components, 
		Now In the Child Component, we need another cascadingParemeter and add Counter Value next to the Child Componets.
		and do the same changes in Grand Child Component.

2) CascadingChild.razor, CascadingGrandChild.razor

		<h3 style="@ElementStyle ; @H1Boder">-Cascading Child Componet - @Counter
		</h3>

	    [CascadingParameter(Name = "Counter")]
		public string Counter { get; set; }

Test : At Initial load, Counter value is zero for all the and at every time we click the button,
		Counter value gets increased by 0.

Note : Now, the Build-In CascadingValue Component has the boolean propery IsFixed="False" and its default value is False.
		lets set it to true and see the behaviou we get
3) CascadingParent.razor
	<CascadingValue Value="@Counter" Name = "Counter" IsFixed="true">
	
Test : Notice that the Counter Value is increased in Parent Component but not in Child and GrandChild
Note : Here we basically telling the Counter CascadingValue is fixed. So blazot effectively turn of monitoring CascadingValue for Changes.
		Even if its changes in the Parent. Its not going to Cascade that change down the component tree.
	Style and BorderStyle intially set by parent component and they never change.
	So, for Performance stand point, it makes sense to turn off Active monitoring So, Lets set IsFixed= tree for
		style and border style values
