	41 Add database row in Blazor :

EmployeeManagement.Web.Services
	Add CreateEmployee() in IEmployeeService
		Task<Employee> CreateEmployee(Employee newEmployee);
	
	Add CreateEmployee() implementation in EmployeeService
		public async Task<Employee> CreateEmployee(Employee newEmployee){
			return awiat httpClient.PostJsonAsync<Employee>("api/employees", newEmployee);
		}

Note : We are going to use EditEmployee component for both creating the new Employee and editing the existing employee.

EditEmployeeBase.cs

Note: Convert Id of string type to integer type

	protected async override task OnInitializedAsync()
	{
		int.TryParse(Id, out int employeeId);
		//if employeeId is not null then we know we have valid employeeId, we are going to use this to edit existing employee
		if(employeeId != 0)
		{
			Employee = await EmployeeService.GetEmployee(int.Parse(id));
		}
		// Here, we do not have employee id in the url, then we are going to use EditEmployee Component, to create the component
		else
		{
			// Default values
			Employee = new Employee
			{
				DepartmentId = 1,
				DateOfBirth = DateTime.Now,
				PhotoPath = "images/nophoto.jpg"
			};
		}
		
		Department = (await DepartmentService.GetDepartments()).ToList();
		Mapper.Map(Employee, EditEmployeeModel);
		
	}

Note : include nophoto.jpg in images folder

EditEmployee.razor
	
	Note : For creating new Employee, there is no route parameter. include routing for create new employee along with updating the Employee
	@page "/editemployee"
	
EditEmployeeBase.cs

	Note : If there is no rote parameter, then HandleValidSubmit method gets called and need to modify code to create employee
	
		protected async Task HandleValidSubmit()
		{
			Mapper.Map(EditEmployeeModel, Employee);
			
			Employee result = null;
			
			if(Employee.EmployeeId != 0)
			{
				result = await EmployeeService.UpdateEmployee(Employee);
			}
			else
			{
				result = await EmployeeService.CreateEmployee(Employee);
			}
					
			if(result != null)
			{
					/* If the update is successfull, navigate to Employee List Component otherwise,
					We stayed on to EditEmployeeBase component, display the validation errors if any.
					*/
					NavigationManager.NavigateTo("/");
			}
		}

Shared -> NavMenu.razor
Note : Below Home Navigation Menu item, just include Create Navigation
		<li class = "nav-item px-3">
			<NavLink class="nav-link" href="/editemployee">
				<span class="oi oi-file" area-hidden="true"></span> Create
			</NavLink>
		</li>

Bug Fix 1 : 
EmailDomainValidator.cs
		include 
			if(value != null)
			{
			}
Bug Fix 1 : 
EmployeeController.cs	
		include await keyword before
			GetEmployeeEmail() in CreateEmployee()
		because if not this can have unintendent consequences.
